# Streams

There are already two great resources that you can use to learn about node streams. One is the stream-adventure (see the Learn Node Interactively section) and the other is a reference called the Stream Handbook.

1. [stream-handbook](https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook#introduction) is a guide, that contains a reference for everything you could possibly need to know about streams.

2. [stream advanture workshop](https://github.com/workshopper/stream-adventure)
