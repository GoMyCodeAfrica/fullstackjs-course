## What is HTTP?

As we discussed in the last lesson, web applications consist of a client-side and a server-side component, and there is data exchanged between those components. 

In order for clients to be able to communicate with web servers, there needs to be a common language, or protocol, that provides rules for how the communication should occur.  The protocol used for Web communication is called HTTP, which stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. 

HTTP defines a set of rules for how clients and servers communicate.  In short, HTTP is the language that all Web clients and servers speak to one another.

All interactions that use HTTP are based on requests and responses- that's the only way clients and servers can communicate.

* Clients send <strong>HTTP requests</strong> to servers to request resources, data or actions on data.

* Servers send <strong>HTTP responses</strong> to clients after handling the requests appropriately.

* HTTP defines <strong>request methods</strong> and response methods that clients and servers use to communicate.

The actions that can be performed with HTTP correlate to the <strong>CRUD</strong> operations:

* creating data
* reading data
* updating data
* deleting data

We'll take a deeper look at these request and response methods in upcoming lessons.
