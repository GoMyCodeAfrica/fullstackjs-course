# Benefits of FP

* **Easy to reason about**: To understand a pure function, all you have to do is think about its input and output. No scope, no randomness, no hassle.
* **Easy to debug**:
* **Composability**: decompose bigger problems into smaller ones.
* **Reuseability**: If you face the same problem twice.
* **Memoization**: memoization is a fancy name for caching. The good thing about caching the outputs of pure functions is they will never be outdated.
