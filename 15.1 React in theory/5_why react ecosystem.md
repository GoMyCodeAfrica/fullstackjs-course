# Why react ? its ecosystem

React can be thought as just a view library. However, we can use many other libraries and tools to create even more powerful apps such as:
  * **Redux**: A state management library. It is based on a simple philosophy: all application data should live in one place
  * **React router**: A routing library that simulates multi-page navigation without reloading the page
  * **Webpack**: An advanced tool that enables the creation of production-ready code from the source code in an automatic way.
  * **Immutable.js**: The problem with JS objects is that they are mutable by nature. This library provides a set of immutable data structures.
  * **create-react-app**: To get started with react with zero configuration, this is the tool to use.
