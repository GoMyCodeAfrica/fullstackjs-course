## Intro

* JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
* JSON is a format for storing and exchanging data

example of a JSON file:

```json
{
  "name": "Samsung Galaxy S5",
  "is_public": true,
  "category": "samrtphone",
  "price": {
    "buying": 590,
    "selling": 730
  },
  "in_stock": 19,
  "accessories": [
    {
      "name": "headphone",
      "price": {
        "buying": 22,
        "selling": 36
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

  * all keys have
