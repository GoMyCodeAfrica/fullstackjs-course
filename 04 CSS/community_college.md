## Objective

To test comprehension of CSS text styling techniques.

## Project brief

You have been provided with some raw HTML for the homepage of an imaginary community college, plus some CSS that styles the page into a two column layout and provides some other rudimentary styling [here](Assessment_community_website). You are to write your CSS additions below the comment at the bottom of the CSS file, to make sure it is easy to mark the bits you have done. Don't worry if some of the selectors are repetitious; we'll let you off in this instance.

<strong>Fonts</strong>:

* First of all, download a couple of free-to-use fonts. Because this is a college, the fonts should be chosen to give the page a fairly serious, formal, trustworthy feel â€” a serif site-wide font for the general text body, coupled with sans-serif or slab serif for the headings might be nice.
* Use a suitable service to generate bulletproof `@font-face` code for these two fonts.
* Apply your body font to the whole page, and your heading font to your headings.

<strong>General text styling</strong>:

* Give the page a site-wide `font-size` of 10px.
* Give your headings and other element types appropriate `font-sizes` defined using a suitable relative unit.
* Give your body text a suitable `line-height`.
Center your top level heading on the page.
* Give your headings a little bit of `letter-spacing` to make them not too too squashed, and allow the letters to breathe a bit.
* Give your body text some `letter-spacing` and `word-spacing`, as appropriate.
* Give the first paragraph after each heading in the `<section>` a little bit of text-indentation, say 20px.

<strong>Links</strong>:


* Give the link, visited, focus, and hover states some colors that go with the color of the horizontal bars at the top and bottom of the page.
* Make it so that links are underlined by default, but when you hover or focus them, the underline disappears.
* Remove the default focus outline from ALL the links on the page.
* Give the active state a noticeably different styling so it stands out nicely, but make it still fit in with the overall page design.
* Make it so that external links have the external link icon inserted next to them.

<strong>Lists</strong>


* Make sure the spacing of your lists and list items works well with the styling of the overall page. Each list item should have the same `line-height` as a paragraph line, and each list should have the same spacing at its top and bottom as you have between paragraphs.
* Give your list items a nice bullet, appropriate for the design of the page. It is up to you whether you choose a custom bullet image or something else.

<strong>Navigation menu</strong>


* Style your navigation menu so that it has an appropriate look for the look and feel for the page.

## Hints

* You don't need to edit the HTML in any way for this exercise.
* You don't necessarily have to make the nav menu look like buttons, but it needs to be a bit taller so that it doesn't look silly on the side of the page; also remember that you need to make this one a vertical nav menu.
