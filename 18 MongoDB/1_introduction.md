# Introduction to MongoDB

MongoDB is an open-source document database that provides high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling.

## Document Database

A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of field and value pairs. 

MongoDB documents are similar to JSON objects. 

The values of fields may include other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents.

The advantages of using documents are:


* Documents (i.e. objects) correspond to native data types in many programming languages.

* Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for expensive joins.

* Dynamic schema.

## Key features

### High Performance

MongoDB provides high performance data persistence. In particular:

* Support for embedded data models reduces I/O activity on database system.

* Indexes support faster queries and can include keys from embedded documents and arrays.

### Rich Query Language

MongoDB supports a rich query language to support read and write operations (CRUD) as well as:

* Data Aggregation

* Text Search and Geospatial Queries.

### High Availability

MongoDBâ€™s replication facility, called replica set, provides:

* automatic failover and

* data redundancy.

A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, providing redundancy and increasing data availability.
