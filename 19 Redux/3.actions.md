Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store.

You send them to the store using store.dispatch().

Actions are plain JavaScript objects. Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed.

Example used in our example:

```javascript
{
  type: "ADD_TODO",
  text: "Buy food"
}
```


A good practice is to not pass the object directly to dispatch, in place we create functions that return this objects.

We centralise then this functions in one file we call it "actions.js"

```javascript
const addTodo = text => {
  return {
    type: "ADD_TODO",
    text
  }
}
```

Later on:
```javascript
store.dispatch(addTodo("Buy food"))
```
