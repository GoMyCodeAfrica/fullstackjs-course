## Intro to Back-End Web Development

This course is all about the basics of back-end web development. Let's take a look at what exactly a backend is and what that consists of.

You should already be familiar with what's involved in front-end web development. The frontend of a web app displays the user interfaces in a web browser and facilitates user interaction.

Back-end web development involves building the brains that will allow a web app to be functional. That functionality depends on handling the <strong>logic</strong> and <strong>data</strong> that a web app needs to track and use. Think of the backend of a web app as the brain that powers it, whereas the frontend would be the personality that users interact with.

When your user interface needs to display data to the user, it sends a request for that data to the backend. The backend is constantly listening for such requests. When it receives a request for data, it communicates with a database to retrieve the data, possibly manipulates the data, and then returns it back to the client.

The frontend is commonly referred to as the <strong>client</strong> and the backend as the <server>server</serv>.

Let's take a deeper look at the components that make up the server-side of our app and how they work together to make a web app functional.

### BackEnd Functions

The backend of a web app must be able to:

* Listen for requests from clients and interpret them
* Perform the appropriate action to provide the client with the desired outcome
* Interact with a database to access and manipulate stored data
* Respond to the client with a status and/or requested data
