## What's react ?
* ReactJS basically is an open-source JavaScript library which is used for building user interfaces specifically for single page applications. It’s used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps.

* React also allows us to create reusable UI components. React was first created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. React first deployed on Facebook’s newsfeed in 2011 and on Instagram.com in 2012.
 Many people choose to think of React as the  `V` in `MVC.`

* We built React to solve one problem: `building large applications with data that changes over time.`

## Why react ?
* Components are better than templates.

* React let’s you choose other tools you want to work with.

* React let’s you use the new ES2015 Syntax or Older JavaScript Syntax.

* You can start small with React.

* React gives you the full power of JavaScript in all aspects of your application instead of giving you a watered-down way to control interactions.

* React uses one-way data-binding.

* When the data changes, React conceptually hits the "refresh" button, and knows to only update the changed parts.

* React makes the developer experience pretty remarkable.
