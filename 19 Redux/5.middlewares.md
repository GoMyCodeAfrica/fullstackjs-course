We will try in this section to create a logger middleware.


Middlewares are executed in sequence when an action get sent to the store.


Example of middleware: Logger

```javascript
const logger = store => next => action => {
  console.log('dispatching', action)
  let result = next(action)
  console.log('next state', store.getState())
  return result
}
```

Next is the next middleware that will be executed it takes an action.


So the middleware can change the action before it get sent to next middleware.

To apply the middleware we change the line that create the store like this:

```javascript
let store = createStore(
  todos,
  // applyMiddleware() tells createStore() how to handle middleware
  applyMiddleware(logger)
)
```
