# Link best practices

There are some best practices to follow when writing links. Let's look at these now.

Use clear link wording

It's easy to throw links up on your page. That's not enough. We need to make our links accessible to all readers, regardless of their current context and which tools they prefer. For example:

* Screenreader users like jumping around from link to link on the page, and reading links out of context.
* Search engines use link text to index target files, so it is a good idea to include keywords in your link text to effectively describe what is being linked to.
* Visual readers skim over the page rather than reading every word, and their eyes will be drawn to page features that stand out, like links. They will find descriptive link text useful.

Let's look at a specific example:

Good link text: <a href="https://firefox.com/">Download Firefox</a>
```html
<p><a href="https://firefox.com/">
  Download Firefox
</a></p>
```

Bad link text: Click <a href="https://firefox.com/">here</a>to download Firefox
```html
<p><a href="https://firefox.com/">
  Click here
</a>
to download Firefox</p>
```

Other tips:

* Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text — URLs look ugly, and sound even uglier when a screen reader reads them out letter by letter.
* Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text — it's just noise. Screen readers tell people there's a link. Visual users will also know there's a link, because links are generally styled in a different colour and underlined (this convention generally shouldn't be broken, as users are so used to it.)
* Keep your link label as short as possible — long links especially annoy screen reader users, who have to hear the whole thing read out.
* Minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places. This can cause problems for screenreader users, who will often bring up a list of the links out of context — several links all labelled "click here", "click here", "click here" would be confusing.

## Use relative links wherever possible

From the description above, you might think that it is a good idea to just use absolute links all the time; after all, they don't break when a page is moved like relative links. However, you should use relative links wherever possible when linking to other locations within the same website (when linking to another website, you will need to use an absolute link):

* For a start, it is a lot easier to scan your code — relative URLs are generally a lot shorter than absolute URLs, which makes reading code much easier.
* Second, it is more efficient to use relative URLs wherever possible. When you use an absolute URL, the browser starts by looking up the real location of the server on the Domain Name Server (DNS; see How the web works for more information), then it goes to that server and finds the file that is being requested. With a relative URL on the other hand, the browser just looks up the file that is being requested, on the same server. So if you use absolute URLs where relative URLs would do, you are constantly making your browser do extra work, meaning that it will perform less efficiently.

## Linking to non-HTML resources — leave clear signposts

When linking to a resource that will be downloaded (like a PDF or Word document) or streamed (like video or audio) or has another potentially unexpected effect (opens a popup window, or loads a Flash movie), you should add clear wording to reduce any confusion. It can be quite annoying for example:

* If you are on a low bandwidth connection, click a link and then a multiple megabyte download starts unexpectedly.
* If you haven't got the Flash player installed, click a link and then suddenly get taken to a page that requires Flash.

Let's look at some examples, to see what kind of text can be used here:
```html
<p><a href="http://www.example.com/large-report.pdf">
  Download the sales report (PDF, 10MB)
</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.example.com/video-stream/">
  Watch the video (stream opens in separate tab, HD quality)
</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.example.com/car-game">
  Play the car game (requires Flash)
</a></p>
```

## Use the download attribute when linking to a download

When you are linking to a resource that is to be downloaded rather than opened in the browser, you can use the download attribute to provide a default save filename. Here's an example with a `download` link to the Windows version of Firefox 39:

```html
<a href="https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-39.0-SSL&os=win&lang=en-US"
   download="firefox-39-installer.exe">
  Download Firefox 39 for Windows
</a>
```

## Active learning: creating a navigation menu

For this exercise, we'd like you to link some pages together with a navigation menu to create a multi-page website. This is one common way in which a website is created — the same page structure is used on every page, including the same navigation menu, so when links are clicked it gives the impression that you are staying in the same place, and different content is being brought up.

You'll need to make local copies of the following four pages, all in the same directory:


* [index.html](active_learning/nav_menu/index.html)
* [projects.html](active_learning/nav_menu/projects.html)
* [pictures.html](active_learning/nav_menu/pictures.html)
* [social.html](active_learning/nav_menu/social.html)

You should:

1. Add an unordered list in the indicated place on one page, containing the names of the pages to link to. A navigation menu is usually just a list of links, so this is semantically ok.
2. Turn each page name into a link to that page.
Copy the navigation menu across to each page.
3. On each page, remove just the link to that same page — it is confusing and pointless for a page to include a link to itself, and the lack of a link acts a good visual reminder of what page you are currently on.

The finished example should end up looking something like this:

<p align="center">
	<img src="images/navigation-example.png" alt="navigation examples">
