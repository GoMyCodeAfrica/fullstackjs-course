# Replicate a design mock-up

The goal of this exercises is to break down a given page mockup into different HTML elements, build a web page that is close to the mockup, then keep iterating until you are satisfied with your result.

# Design

1. Page at minimum include 4 images, title text, regular(paragraph) text and logo.

2. No `<div>` tags are without a `class` or `id`.

3. The page structure can be interpreted from the html code.

4. We encourage you to utilize a grid based layout such that the body has an element that serves as the container for rows and columns.

# Separation of concerns

1. Completely separates structures (HTML) from design/style (CSS)

2. There should be no `style` attributes present within the body of the HTML Document. (It's acceptable to include HTML attributes for `hight` and `width` of `img` elements)

3. There should be no `style` elements in the document.
