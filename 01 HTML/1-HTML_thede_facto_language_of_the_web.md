# HTML, the default language of the web

## What is HTML?

* HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
* HTML is the language of **creating content on the web**.
* All webpages are made up of HTML elements
* An HTML element can be a text, an image, a link, a form, a button, a video ...
* An HTML element can contain other elements

## Activity: Divide webpages into elements

* Divide the follwing webpages using **a pen, a paper and the following element names** :
  * header
  * footer
  * section
  * headline
  * navigation menu
  * link
  * button
  * image
  * text
  * list
  * list item
  * div (like division, if you none of the above names apply)
* You can nest elements inside each other. For example, a "list" element can contain "list item" elements
* You are only allowed to use rectangles
* Some elements are already filled for you ;)
* **Hint**: Start from the big elements and then move to smaller ones
