We can create multiple reducer each one return one state with the function "combineReducers"

let's add another Reducer that handles user:

```javaScript
const user = (state = {}, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'CHANGE_USER':
      return action.user
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

Then we need to combine Reducers and recreate our store

```javaScript
let store = createStore(combineReducers({
  todos,
  user
}))
```

now we can access todos and user from the store state:
```javascript
console.log(store.getState().user)
console.log(store.getState().todos)
```

Now when we dispatch an action to the store every Reducer will recieve it and return a state.
