We can create multiple reducers each one handles one state (Todos, users etc.).

Then we combine them with the function "combineReducers" and we pass the result to "createStore".

Let's add another Reducer that handles user:

```javaScript
const user = (state = {}, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'CHANGE_USER':
      return action.user
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

Then we need to combine Reducers and recreate our store

```javaScript
let store = createStore(combineReducers({
  todos,
  user
}))
```

Now we can access todos and user from the store state:
```javascript
console.log(store.getState().user)
console.log(store.getState().todos)
```

Now when we dispatch an action to the store every Reducer will receive it and return a state.
