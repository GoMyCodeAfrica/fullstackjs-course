Any Redux application has a store, where we save our data.

The store has the following responsibilities:
* Holds application state;
* Allows access to state via getState();
* Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action);
* Registers listeners via subscribe(listener);
* Handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe(listener).

Let's write our first store to save TODOs.
```javascript
import { createStore } from 'redux'

// this is a reducer, we will talk about it next
const todos = (state = [], action) => {
  console.log(action)
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return state.concat([action.text])
    default:
      return state
  }
}
let store = createStore(todos)
```

Let's use some of the store methods
```javascript

// subscribe to store, anything happens we will be notified
let unsubscribe = store.subscribe(
  () => console.log(store.getState())
)

// we can use unsubscribe anytime we want to unsubscribe
console.log(unsubscribe)

// Let's change the state of the store
// dispatch take as argument an action
// We will talk about actions later
store.dispatch({
  type: "ADD_TODO",
  text: "Buy food"
})

store.dispatch({
  type: "ADD_TODO",
  text: "Eat food"
})

```
