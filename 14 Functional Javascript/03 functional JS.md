# FP in Javascript

* Javascript is a multi-paradigm language.

## Higher-order functions

* A higher-order function is a **function** that can take another **function** as an argument, or that returns a **function** as a result
* Here are some examples of higher-order functions we already use:
  * `setTimeout` for executing a function after a certain **delay**
  * `setInterval` for executing a function after **each time interval**
  * `$` JQuery can take a function as input and only execute it when the DOM is ready

## Activity

* Display an alert box that says `Hello` after 3 seconds (3000 milliseconds) using `setTimeout()`.

* Display an alert box that says `Hello` every 3 seconds with `setInterval()`

## Array.prototype functions

* In the next slide, we will cover many higher-order functions that can help us manipulate arrays.
* Since most of the data is in the form of arrays, these functions will be very helpful to us
* Here is the list for reference:
  * `map`
  * `filter`
  * `find`
  * `findIndex`
  * `some`
  * `every`
  * `reduce`
