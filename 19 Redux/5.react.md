First install the package ```npm install --save react-redux```

We need to wrap our App component in a Provider which take as params "store".

* <Provider>  magically make the store available to all container components in the application without passing it explicitly.

* You only need to use it once when you render the root component

```javaScript
render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```


Second step is to connect our components to the store to read from state and send action to reducers.

So in place of exporting the Component itself we export the return value of function "connect" which connect our store to the component.

We call the exported object "container".

Containers wrap components and provide them data from the store using "props".

```javaScript
export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Todos)
```

* mapStateToProps tells how to transform the current Redux store state into the props you want to pass to a presentational component
* mapDispatchToProps receives the dispatch() method and returns callback props that you want to inject into the presentational component.

Let's write this 2 methods:
```javaScript
const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return {
    todos: state.todos
  } // in the component we will revieve todos as this.props.todos
}

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
  return {
    addTodo: text => {
      dispatch({
        type: "ADD_TODO",
        text: text
      })
    } // in the component we will revieve addTodo as this.props.addTodo
  }
}
```
